Welcome to Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics (CMCL) 2021.

This year CMCL will be co-located with [NAACL 2021](https://2021.naacl.org/), in Mexico City, Mexico, on June 10, 2021.

The workshop provides a venue for work in computational psycholinguistics, including computational and mathematical modeling of linguistic representations, development and processing.

We invite contributions that apply methods from computational linguistics to problems in the cognitive modeling of any and all natural language abilities.
