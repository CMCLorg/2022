CMCL 2021 Shared Task: Predicting
 human reading patterns

The benefits of eye movement data for machine learning
 have been assessed in various domains, including NLP and computer vision. 
Being
 able to accurately predict eye-tracking features will advance the fieldâ€™s understanding of language processing.  Eye
 tracking provides millisecond-accurate records on where humans look when they are reading and are useful in explanatory research of language processing.
The
 use of a standardized dataset will facilitate comparisons between models and the analysis of their varying capabilities. In this shared task, we present the challenge of predicting eye tracking-based metrics recorded during English sentence processing. We
 are interested in both cognitive modelling approaches as well as linguistically motivated approaches (e.g., language models) for submission.


Task
The shared task if formulated as a regression task to
 predict 5 eye-tracking features:
(1) number of fixations (nFix), total number of fixations
 on the current word; 
(2) first fixation duration (FFD), the duration of the
 first fixation on the prevailing word; 
(3) total reading time (TRT), the sum of all fixation
 durations on the current word, including regressions; 
(4) go-past time (GPT), the sum of all fixations prior
 to progressing to the right of the current word, including regressions to previous words that originated from the current word;
(5) fixation proportion (fixProp), the proportion of
 participants that fixated the current word (proxy for how likely a word is to be fixated).




Data


We will use the ZuCo eye-tracking dataset recorded during normal reading (1000 sentences). The
 training data will contain approx. 800 sentences, and the test set 200 sentences.


The data provided will contain normalized features (feature values between 0 and 100 to facilitate
 evaluation via MAE) averaged over all participants.






Example:



word_id	sentence_id	word	nFix	FFD	GPT	TRT 	fixProp
0	1	After	6.47	23.47	11.61	7.48	47.06
1	1	the	7.19	20.79	10.39	6.70	52.94
2	1	show	12.22	35.61	16.42	13.84	76.47
3	1	was	7.19	20.87	9.62	6.21	58.82
4	1	cancelled,	12.94	27.61	13.94	12.20	70.59

Note: Any
 additional data source is allowed, as long as it is freely available to the research community. For example, additional eye tracking corpora, additional features such as brain activity signals, pre-trained language models, etc.



Evaluation


We will evaluate the prediction against the ground truth using the mean absolute error (MAE).

The winning system
 will be the one with the best average MAE across all 5 eye-tracking features.
