## Workshop Description
Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics (CMCL) 2021 is a one-day workshop held in conjunction with the conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL). The goal of CMCL is providing a venue for computational research on cognitive theories of language processing, representation and acquisition. The 2021 workshop follows in the tradition of earlier meetings at ACL 2010, ACL 2011, NAACL-HLT 2012, ACL 2013, ACL 2014, NAACL 2015, EACL 2017, LSA 2018, NAACL 2019 and EMNLP 2020.


## Invited Speakers

We are pleased to announce the following invited speakers for the 2021 edition:

- ~~Marco Baroni (Facebook AI – Pompeu Fabra University of Barcelona)~~* Afra Alishahi (Tilburg University)
- Zoya Bylinskii (Adobe Research)

* We would like to thank Marco Baroni (Facebook AI – Pompeu Fabra University of Barcelona) for his support to CMCL.


## Scope and Topics

Topics of interest for the workshop include:

- Stochastic models of factors influencing a speaker’s production or comprehension decisions
- Models of semantic interpretation, including psychologically realistic notions of word and phrase meaning and composition
- Incremental parsers for diverse grammar formalisms and their psychological plausibility
- Models of speaker-specific linguistic adaptation and/or generalization
- Models of first and second language acquisition and bilingual language processing
- Behavioral tasks for better understanding neural models of linguistic representation
- Models and empirical analysis of the relationship between mechanistic psycholinguistic principles and pragmatics or semantics
- Models of lexical acquisition, including phonology, morphology, and semantics
- Psychologically motivated models of grammar induction
- Psychologically plausible models of lexical or conceptual representations
- Models of language disorders, such as aphasia, dyslexia, or dysgraphia
- Behavioral datasets or resources for modeling language processing or production in languages other than English
- Models of language comprehension difficulty
- Models of language learning and generalization
- Models of linguistic information propagation and language evolution in communities
- Cognitively-motivated models of discourse and dialogue 
- Network Science and Language Processing


## Workshop Submissions

We accept three categories of papers: regular workshop papers, extended abstracts and cross-submissions. Only regular workshop papers will be included in the proceedings as archival publications. All submissions should be in PDF format and made through the Softconf website ([https://www.softconf.com/naacl2021/cmcl2021/](https://www.softconf.com/naacl2021/cmcl2021/)). To facilitate double-blind reviewing, submitted manuscripts should not include any identifying information about the authors. Submissions with associated preprints (e.g. arXiv) will be considered. 
Submissions must be formatted using NAACL 2021 templates, available at:  [https://2021.naacl.org/calls/style-and-formatting/](https://2021.naacl.org/calls/style-and-formatting/).

Regular Workshop Papers can be either full (8 pages of content + references) or short papers (4 pages + references) reporting original and unpublished research that combines cognitive modeling and computational linguistics. If a workshop paper has been submitted elsewhere, the authors have to declare it at submission time. Papers to be presented at CMCL 2021 must be withdrawn from other venues.

Extended Abstracts (from 2 to 4 pages + references) describe preliminary work or results that have not been published before. Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings.

We will also accept cross-submissions (from 2 to 4 pages + references) for papers on related topics that have already appeared in a non-NLP venue (e.g. CogSci). These papers will be presented at the workshop, but will not be included in the proceedings. Interested authors are asked to add a note on the original venue in the submission.


### SHARED TASK ON EYE-TRACKING DATA PREDICTION
Eye-tracking provides millisecond-accurate records on where humans look when they are reading and are useful in explanatory research of language processing. Being able to accurately predict eye-tracking features will advance the field's understanding of language processing. The use of a standardized dataset will facilitate comparisons between models and the analysis of their varying capabilities.
In this shared task, we present the challenge of predicting eye tracking-based metrics recorded during English sentence processing. We are interested in both cognitive modelling approaches as well as linguistically motivated approaches (e.g., language models) for submission. The shared task will be formulated as a regression task to predict 5 eye-tracking features from the ZuCo corpus: number of fixations, first fixation duration, total reading, go-past time, and fixation proportion. 
More details will be available soon on the CMCL website. The trial data will be released on January 15, 2021.
